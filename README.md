# Les Petits Bots Technical Test

This project was made to create a movie app fetching items from the Les Petits Bots's API. You can update a movie by editing the forms, as it sends a PUT request to change movie's datas.

Errors are handled by inputs. Movie's name can't be blank and contains over 256 characters. Same as description that can't be blank or contains more than 2000 characters.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
